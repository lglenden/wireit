<h1>About</h1>

<p>This tool was created in a collaboration with the <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~able/research/sorascs.html">Software Architectures for Socio-Cultural Systems (SORASCS) project</a>, which itself is a collaboration between the <a href="http://www.isri.cmu.edu/">Institute of Software Research (ISR)</a> and the <a href="http://www.casos.cs.cmu.edu/">Center for Computational Analysis of Social and Organizational Systems (CASOS)</a> at <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/index.shtml">Carnegie Mellon University</a>.  The developers on this project were five full-time <a href="http://mse.isri.cmu.edu/software-engineering/">Master of Software Engineering (MSE)</a> students known as "Team FACEO5."</p>
