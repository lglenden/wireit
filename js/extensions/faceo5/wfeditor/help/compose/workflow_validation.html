<h1>Workflow Validation</h1>

<p>This page details <i>syntactic validation</i> of a workflow.  This is different from <i>semantic
analysis</i> that is discussed in a different section of the user manual.  Syntactic validation is
necessary in order for the workflow to execute.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, there are two types of syntactic checks in the tool.  Some of them are
<i>dynamic</i>, which means that they happen instantly during the construction of a workflow.  Others
can only be checked when you explcitily validate the workflow.</p>

<h2><a name="1"></a>Dynamic syntactic checks</h2>

<p>Dynamic syntactic checks are those that happen instantly during the construction of a workflow.
They are intended to give you immediate feedback so that you can quickly correct these problems.
Current dynamic syntactic checks include:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Ports type check</b>.  This checks the type of the ports between two services being
connected.  These types should match; otherwise this action is not allowed.</li>
<li><b>Service configuration parameter type check</b>.  This checks the type of the value for
a configuration parameter that is entered.  Invalid values may not be entered.</li>
<li><b>Self connection</b>.  This checks for whether you're trying to connect two ports on the
same service to each other.</li>
<li><b>Single connection between two ports</b>.  This checks that only one connection (wire)
is allowed between two ports.</li>
<li>Input-Input and Output-Output</b>.  This checks that all connections are between only one
input and only one output.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="2"></a>Syntactic validation</h2>

<p>You can syntactically validate a workflow in its entirety by clicking the "Validate" button in
the compose perspective.  This runs all syntactic checks against the currently opened workflow and
notifies you of any problems.  In addition to the checks listed in the previous section, this
validation also includes:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Fork service connection</b>.  This checks that a fork service can be connected to as
many data services as desired, but at most one of a normal service or exposed.</li>
<li><b>Fork service exposed</b>.  This checks that a fork service cannot be exposed on its
input port.</li>
<li><b>Required ports</b>.  This checks that all ports marked as "required" either have a
connection or are exposed.</li>
<li><b>Required configuration parameters</b>.  This checks that all configuration parameters
marked as "required" either have a value, UI service connection, or are exposed.</li>
</ul>
