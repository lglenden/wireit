<h1>Data Service Configuration</h1>
<p>Data services will allow the user to access a pre-existent set of files stored on SORASCS and
also provide opportunity to create new data sets that can be used in the different workflows.</p>

<h3>Using data on SORASCS<a name="DataServices-DataOnSORASCS">.</a></h3>
<p>Data services offered by SORASCS will be organized on two leves:<br />
<ol>
    <li><b>Project</b>: The data will be grouped in a project that will contain data related to some
    specific topic, for example: data related to Sudan events.</li>
    <li><b>Categories</b>: The data inside the projects will be organized depending on the nature of
    the data, for example: reports, thesauri, lists, etc.</li>
</ol>

<p>Aside from this organization, data services can be either input or output, if the user has
permission (configured in SORASCS), he or she will be able to change the direction of the data
service, there will be a small icon next to the data service in the canvas to switch between input
or output. By performing this action, any wires that may be connected to the data service will
disconnect.</p>

<h3>Uploading local data to SORASCS<a name="DataServices-UploadDataToSORASCS">.</a></h3>
<p>As we can see in the right section of the screen, there's the properties column that contains
minimap, service properties, workflow properties and data properties, let's review <b>data
properties</b>.</p>
<p>This section will allow the user to create new data sources
(<a href="#DataServices-InputData">input</a> or <a href="#DataServices-OutputData">output</a>) that
will be available as any othere data services that is already in SORASCS. Let's proceed with the
creation of output data.</p>

<h3>Configuring data services<a name="DataServices-ConfiguringDataServices">.</a></h3>
<h4>Output data<a name="DataServices-OutputData">.</a></h4>
<p>First, we activate the output option and we will notice that one of the fields (File(s))
disappears, since we won't upload any data this is expected. We proceed with the setting of the
next properties:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Name</b>: The name that the data will have.</li>
    <li><b>Project</b>: The project (as explained <a href="#DataServices-DataOnSORASCS">before</a>)
    the data will be part of (Sudan data, Russia espionage, World domination, etc)</li>
    <li><b>Category</b>: The category will allow the user to set the type of information that this
    output will be, for example: thesauri, list or any other category that the user wants to create,
    we can set any amount of categories to the data just by clicking on the plus and minus symbol
    below the category input.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, we press the create button to create the new output data service.</p>

<h4>Input data<a name="DataServices-InputData">.</a></h4>
<p>First, we activate the input option and proceed with the setting of the next properties.</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Name</b>: The name that that the data will have.</li>
    <li><b>File</b>: The files that will be part of this data service will be set by the user, the
    user can browse and select any file in his or her computer, the user cannot select directories, 
        <ul>
            <li><b>Sending multiple files</b>: The only way to send multiple files is to zip them
            and then selecting it.</li>
            <li><b>Infinite amount of files</b>: The user can add as many files as needed, by
            pressing the plus button below the file field, we can add more fields and by pressing
            the minus button we remove them.</li>
        </ul>
    <li><b>Project</b>: The project (as explained <a href="#DataServices-DataOnSORASCS">before</a>)
    the data will be part of (Sudan data, Russia espionage, World domination, etc)</li>
    <li><b>Category</b>: The category will allow the user to set the type of information that this
    output will be, for example: thesauri, list or any other category that the user wants to create,
    we can set any amount of categories to the data just by clicking on the plus and minus symbol
    below the category input.</li>
</ul>
<p>After setting these properties, we create the data input service by clicking on the create
button. Once the data is on SORASCS, a new element will appear in the palette making it available to
use it like any other data service. The type of the new data service is provided by SORASCS after it
has been created.</p>
