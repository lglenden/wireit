<h1>Service Configuration</h1>

<p>This page details how to find and configure a service in your workflow.  It also discusses the
advanced feature of connecting a UI service to provide values for parameters dynamically at
execution-time.</p>

<h2><a name="1"></a>Find a service on the palette</h2>

<p>As discussed in the <a href="perspective_layout.html">compose perspective layout</a>, there are a
number of ways to find a service on the palette.  First of all, all the services that are available to
you based on your SORASCS user account are displayed in a default categorization.  They are first
broken out by their type (service, data, utility, or workflow) and then broken out further by their
main functionality.</p>

<p>At the top of the palette is an area that you can use to filer the displayed services based on
their name.  As you type in this box, the services that do <i>not</i> match the filter are
dynmically removed from the palette.  Clearing the filter will return all the services to the
palette.</p>

<p>Beneath the filter are buttons for service searching.  You can do an advanced search based on
service meta-information.  This includes the name, the author, the description, the type, and any
set tags.  The search filters out those services that don't match from the palette.  Clicking the
"clear all" button will return all missing services to the palette.  Beneath the search are buttons\
for service re-categorization.  You can do an advanced categorization based on the available tags,
or return to the default.</p>

<p>Below this is the actual list of services.  This comprises of two parts: the first expandable
panel is for those services that you have marked as a favorite.  You can mark/unmark services on
favorites by clicking on the star icon on the service.  Your favorites are associated with your
user account and persist across browser sessions.  Thick services cannot be marked as favorites
because they are unique to the specific computer that you are using.</p>

<p>Finally is the list of services.  Here you can see all available services that match whatever
filter, search, and categorization that you have selected.  You can add services to your workflow by
dragging and dropping them from the palette onto the composition canvas.</p>

<h2><a name="2"></a>Configure service parameters</h2>

<p>Many of the services have configuration parameters that change how the service operations.  These
parameters can be configured in two places: first on the service itself in the workflow and second
on the right-hand side of the perspective in the "Service Properties" panel.  Any changes that you
make in one configuration place will be refelcted in the other place.</p>

<p>What parameters are available depends on the individual service.  Generally services will either
have a text box for strings or numbers, or a dropdown list of choices.</p>

<h2><a name="3"></a>Connect a UI service</h2>

<p>One of the advanced features of the tool is to connect a "UI service" to one or more configuration
parameters for a service.  What this means is that those parameters are not set <i>statically</i>
during the composition of the workflow.  Rather, they are set <i>dynamically</i> during the
execution of the workflow.  The tool will prompt the user for those values when that point in the
workflow is reached during execution.</p>

<p>To connect a UI service to a service's configuration parameters, you must first drag-and-drop the
UI service from the "Utilities" section of the palette.  This service is a bit different from the
others because it is limited in the things that it can connect to.  Its purpose is to provide a
form like the one you see on the service, but during execution time.</p>

<p>The UI service also allows you to add/remove as many ports as you want.  This allows you to have
more than one configuration parameter in the execution-time pop-up window.  However, the relationship
between a UI service and a normal service is one-to-one; in other words, you can't have more than one
UI service connected to one normal service, and you can't have one UI service connected to more than
one normal service.</p>
