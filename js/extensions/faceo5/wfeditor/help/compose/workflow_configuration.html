<h1>Workflow Configuration</h1>

<p>This page details how to configure your workflow by saving intermediate results and setting
workflow properties.  These are both intermediate features that are not necessary for the normal
operation of the workflow tool.</p>

<h2><a name="1"></a>Save intermediate results</h2>

<p>The tool allows you to save the intermediate results of a workflow.  Normally, a workflow
represents a complete transformation/analysis of data from end to end, and you are interested in
viewing the final result of the analysis.  However, for various reasons you may wish to also save
intermediate results part-way through the workflow.</p>

<p>To accomplish this, you must first connect a "Fork" service at the location where you want to
save the intermediate results.  The fork takes one wire connection and splits it into two (or more)
connections.  Once the connection has been split, you can connect one of them to a data source to
store the intermediate result and another connection to the rest of the workflow as needed.</p>

<p>There are some restrictions on the use of the Fork service.  Right now the tool only supports
liner workflows, which means that the one of the forked connections can continue on to a non-data
service.</p>

<h2><a name="2"></a>Configure workflow properties</h2>

<p>Properties of the workflow can be configured in the panel labeled "Workflow Properties" on the
right side of the perspective.  In this area you can set the name, description, and tags of the
workflow.  The tags affect how the workflow is categorized when it shows up in the palette.</p>
