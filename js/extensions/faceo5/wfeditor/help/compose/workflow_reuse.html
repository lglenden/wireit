<h1>Workflow Re-Use</h1>

<p><b>TODO</b></p>

<h2><a name="1"></a>Packaging a workflow</h2>

<h2><a name="2"></a>Using a packaged workflow</h2>

<p>After you package a workflow, you can now use it in a different workflow as an internal module.
You can find a workflow in the palette under Workflows -> appropreate categories
 (e.g. If the category is author, it should show up under your user name.
 If the category is tag, it should show up under the tag's name which you specified
 when creating a workflow.)
Now you can drag and drop the workflow on the canvas to reuse as an internal workflow.</p>

<h2><a name="3"></a>Drilldown a workflow within a workflow</h2>

<p>After you drag and drop a workflow, you should see a small plus button on the title of
 the workflow. This is the button to drill down the workflow. In order to drill down, you
 first need to save the workflow.  </p>
<p>After saving, click the plus button, then the internal workflow is opened in a different tab.
 Some of the buttons and properties are disabled (e.g. "Delete" button, workflow properties, etc.).
 You can modify the workflow in this tab as you like, such as replacing the data service with
 your own data service. </p>
<p>In order to go back to the parent workflow, you can click "Close" button. If you have
 changed anything in this internal workflow, the system should raise an alert which asks you
 if you really wants to close the workflow. If you want to discard the changes and go back to
 the parent workflow, just click "Yes" button. If you want to save the changes you made, click
 "No" and save the internal workflow by clicking "Save" button.
